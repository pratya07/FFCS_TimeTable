# FFCS_TimeTable
FFCS stands for Fully Flexible CreditSystem due to which students in VIT can plan their own schedule by selecting the courses, teachers, slots, locations and what not.
It turns out that this “freedom” doesn’t really help much, merely due to the large number of student competing for a smaller number of seats in various courses.The members of this group themselves faced this
problem. Making the time table itself if a challenging task, let alone sit and select it before some others select it.
This necessity was the mother of our invention, the “Time Table Generator”.
To create an algorithm that assists and solves all problems faced by a student while registering courses for FFCS.
